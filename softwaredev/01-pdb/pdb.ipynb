    "When we develop software applications, we inevitably make mistake and produce bugs.  Some are subtle, some are obvious.  In many cases, using a *debugger* can be of great assistance in identifying the source of problems.  Typically we use these to inspect the state of programs in the middle them running; this can often provide more insight than simply looking at results, or even scattering `print()` or logging statements in portions you are concerned about."

    "Python itself comes with a visually bare-bones debugger called `pdb`.  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) designed for Python also often include their own debugging capability.  However, a class of programs—including some IDEs or editors—merely piggyback on the capabilities that are already present in `pdb`.  These often provide an friendlier user interface, but identical capabilities.  `ipdb` and `pudb` are examples of this that can be installed with `pip` or `conda`."
